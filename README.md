# qshare

A quick share to simplify the process of sharing files, by deploying a
minimalistic server.

At this stage, it is the example from
(serve-index)[https://github.com/expressjs/serve-index].


Usage:
```shell
    qshare [PORT] [DIR]

    PORT defaults to 1337
    DIR defaults to cwd
```

Install:
```shell
    npm install -g qshare
    or
    sudo npm install -g qshare
```
